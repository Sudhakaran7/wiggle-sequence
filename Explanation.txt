A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. 
The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
Given an array, find whether the given array is wiggle sequence or not.
return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original 
sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Input Description:
First line contains, n the size of array in integer.(1<n<1000)
Second line contains, n elements of array in integer.

Output Description:
Print the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence

Sample Input:
6
1 7 4 9 2 6

Sample Output:
6

explanation:
The difference betweeen each elements have negative and positive alternatievly. so the whole array is a wiggle sequence.
